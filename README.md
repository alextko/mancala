# REPO Overview #
This repo contains a Manacala game as well as a fun UI to play on. There is a readme in the Front end & backend folder to get the bot setup on your local computer - howver unless you train your own model you with my scripts you will not be able to play against RL bot (The models are too large to share without paying)


------------------
## Tech Stack: ##
- Front End: HTML/CSS/JS 
- Back End: Python/Flask
- ML Models: Saved as pickle files 
- Model exploration: Juyter notebooks 







## Next Steps: ##
1. Use Tensor flow to train a deep learning bot ( that would take up less space than the current Qlearning bot so i would be able to upload that)

## Player types: ##
1. Normal Player: AKA human inputing moves
2. Random Bot: randomly generated moves
3. Smart Bot: Bot that makes inteligent moves based off a rule based system
4. Reinforcement learning (State based Q learning) Bot: Bot training script included, model is created and saved to a pickle file. File is too large so you must create train your own.
